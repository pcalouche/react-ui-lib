Proof of concept for creating an npm React JS UI library.  It demonstrates the following:

1. Using [Rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en) to build ES and Common JS modules
1. UsingBootstrap and Reactstrap to help build its custom components
1. Bundling images
1. A pattern for organizing and styling UI components with SCSS
1. A pattern for loading and customizing Bootstrap's SCSS
1. A demo application that uses the library
1. NPM scripts for live reload of the library during development.
